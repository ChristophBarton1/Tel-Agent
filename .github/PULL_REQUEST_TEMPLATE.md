## Checklist

- [ ] Everything I wrote — code, comments, commit messages — is in **English**
- [ ] This PR does **one thing**
- [ ] I have not added any credential, real recording, or real transcript
- [ ] New configuration is documented in `.env.example` with a safe placeholder

**If this touches the call path (`agent/`):**

- [ ] Nothing on the audio path blocks — it is `async` throughout
- [ ] I have considered the latency budget (§B4: under 800 ms from end of caller
      speech to first audio out) and stated the impact below
- [ ] If it touches speech, I tested it **in German** — English alone proves little for
      this project

Latency impact:

<!-- Numbers if you have them, "none" if it does not touch the call path. -->

## Before you open this

Tel-Agent is at **Milestone 0** — one real phone call, answered, message taken,
transcript printed. Nothing else is being built yet.

**Feature PRs will be pointed at [IDEAS.md](../IDEAS.md) rather than merged.** That is
not a judgement on the idea; it is how this project stays finishable. Bug fixes,
documentation, specification corrections, and anything that helps Milestone 0 work are
welcome now.

Security problem? **Do not open a PR** — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
